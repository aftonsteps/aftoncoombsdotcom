  description= "Hi there! My name is Afton and I'm a data scientist, developer, artist, and educational researcher with eight years of experience in the field. I am currently enrolled as a master's student in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology while continuing to work part-time as a developer and data science consultant. My interests include machine learning, experimentation, data/analytics engineering, tooling development for data science, data visualization, and interactive design. While at GT, I am specializing in interactive intelligence and carrying out research concerned with student opportunities and outcomes in the field of computer science. When Iâ€™m not working on software or data, you can often find me practicing my other love (ðŸ‘žðŸ‘žðŸŽµ) on the dance floor or in the studio."
