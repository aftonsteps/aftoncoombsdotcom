My interests include data science tooling, data visualization, forecasting, experimentation, and text analytics. I also get really excited about fraud prevention, online safety, and generally keeping things safe. Iâ€™m a part-time student at Georgia Tech, where Iâ€™m currently researching student opportunities and outcomes. When Iâ€™m not working, you can probably find me practicing on the dance floor or in the studio. ðŸ‘žðŸŽµ"
