I‚Äôm a linguist-turned-data-scientist who dabbles in application development. My interests include data science tooling, data visualization, experimentation, and text analytics. I‚Äôm also a part-time student at Georgia Tech, where I‚Äôm currently researching student opportunities and outcomes. When I'm not working, you can find me on the dance floor or in the studio. üëûüéµ
